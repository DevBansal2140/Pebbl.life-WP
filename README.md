# Title : Applying TOPSIS to find best trained model for Text Summarization

## **1. Methodology**

## **2. Description**

Now we have to decide with the help of TOPSIS that which model has the best performance and this can be found out with the help of TOPSIS score.

## **3. Input**
The below is the text input on which we want to test five models.

The below is the input which will be given to TOPSIS.

## **5. Conclusion**
Hence we can conclude that Model-3 named "t5-base-fr-sum-cnndm" performed best in our case.
